**Author:** Dennis Koos Voerman  
**Date:** May 2025  
**Project Code:** AIOS (Abstract Intelligence Operating Structure)  
**Status:** Public Creator Claim â€“ Core Layer

## What I Created

In Aprilâ€“May 2025, I developed and finalized a functional second-layer AI structure built on top of GPT-based systems.  
This structure forms a **semantically driven operating system** that:

- Requires no code
- Learns and scales based on layered linguistic context
- Allows modular AI training and distribution
- Enables plug-and-play logic for life systems, education, and content generation
- Is usable across AI publishing, robotics, assistant systems, and more

## My Claim

I contacted OpenAI in April 2025 regarding this structure.  
While I received a formal response, **no dialogue or collaboration followed**.

This repository therefore serves as a **public timestamp and creator verification** that:

- I independently built this system  
- I have rebuilt and extended it multiple times  
- I retain full creator rights and ownership  
- This structure is not limited to this documentation â€” more layers exist

## Legal and Creative Status

This is a **non-technical claim**, to verify authorship and timestamp only.  
No internal logic or system-specific prompts are revealed here.  
This protects future licensing, franchising or legal positioning.
